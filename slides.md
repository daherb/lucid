# The first section

## The first slide
With just some __text__ in _various_ styles ~~in it~~.

## The second slide
A first, multiline paragraph with some random words and even a correctly placed footnote[^1]. 
Can you believe that? Because honestly I thought automatically placing footnotes was very hard.

And a second paragraph here.

[^1]: ...And this is the footnote.

## Some bullet points
- one
- two
  - one
    - one
    - two
  - two 
  - three
- three

## And a nested numbered list
1. one
2. two
   1. one
      1. one
      2. two
   2. two
   3. three
3. three

## Another text slide

Where the text

### Is followed by a subheading

And some more text

## A quote
Introduced by some text, here are

> Some words of wisdom

And a comment

# The fancy section

## An image
![With a caption](sbx.png)

## Some code

A syntax-highlighted code example: 

```haskell
haskellExample :: From -> To
haskellExample from = to
```

Plus some `inline monospaced text`!

## A little bit of math mode
Here is a pretty senseless formula:

$\sum \pi r^3$

With equal spacing above and below, _obviously_.

## And finally a table

A very realistic example, of course:

| __col a__ | __col b__ | __col c__ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a1 | b1 | c1 |
| a2 | b2 | c2 |
